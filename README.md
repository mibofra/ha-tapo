Home Assistant custom component for TP-Link Tapo devices, with support for S200B smart button sensors.

## Features

- Device information sensors (model, firmware version, MAC address, etc.)
- Local polling (no cloud required)
- Home Assistant events for button presses

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Install "Tapo" from HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via Settings > Devices & Services

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/tapo` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via Settings > Devices & Services

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Tapo"
4. Enter your Tapo account credentials:
   - Username: Your Tapo account email/username
   - Password: Your Tapo account password

## Supported Devices

- S200B Smart Button

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.1 or later
- Tapo Python library (installed automatically)

## Button Click Detection

The integration detects button clicks by polling the trigger logs from the S200B device. When a button is pressed:

1. **Home Assistant Event**: An event `tapo_button_pressed` is fired with:
   - `click_type`: `single_click` or `double_click`
   - `event_id`: Unique ID of the event
   - `timestamp`: Unix timestamp of when the button was pressed
   - `device_id`: Device identifier

2. **Sensor**: A sensor "Tapo Last Button Press" shows the last click type and includes:
   - Last event time (ISO format and readable format)
   - Last event ID
   - Last event type

### Using Button Events in Automations

You can create automations triggered by button presses:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Single Click Action"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: tapo_button_pressed
        event_data:
          click_type: single_click
    action:
      - service: light.toggle
        target:
          entity_id: light.example

  - alias: "Double Click Action"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: tapo_button_pressed
        event_data:
          click_type: double_click
    action:
      - service: scene.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: scene.example
```

## Notes

The integration polls trigger logs every 2 seconds to detect button presses. This provides near real-time detection of single and double clicks.
